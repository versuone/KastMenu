kastmenu and kastmenu-server are merged in one:

- kastmenu becomes kastagent
- kastmenu-server is renamed as kastmenu, so kastmenu-server becomes fully GNU open source under kastmenu GPL 3 License.
- kastagent and is embedded into kastmenu as kastagent-<version>.tar.gz
under directory <kastmenu>/kastagent.
Kastagent is fully deployed by Kastmenu to local or remote machine.
